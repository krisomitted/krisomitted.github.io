			Today marks the beginning of my journey into the Darklands. I'm a little bit nervous, but it's not like I haven't done this before! I'll be sure to document my journey with love and dedication.<br><br>Although... I must say, it's gotten off to a rough start. I got a bit lost trying to find the Great Candy House that a friend had told me about. I found a rather nice, homely cabin in the woods a ways from the port I arrived at, but no one was home so I couldn't ask for help. But luckily I was approached by a really tall man who introduced himself as Wolfgang. I laughed a little when I heard his name. It seemed to match his looks perfectly. Wolfgang was very kind—though a bit too kind I suppose... but I best not think too much about that—and gave me directions to find the Great Candy House. He even offered me a place to stay for the night (he said that cabin was his!), but I figured I should cover some ground first.<br><br>At the moment, I'm taking a rest. After passing the waterfall, I came across a small village and met a kind, although slightly nervous couple. They've allowed me to stay for the night. I'm very thankful and their bread is delicious! Tomorrow I will continue the journey.<br><br>Until then!<br><br> K.
