			I will cut to the chase: I still have not found the Great Candy House.<br><br>I woke up a bit late today, feeling a bit under the weather. Still, I pushed on and gathered my things and was set to leave. That husband and wife duo, nervous as they were, gave me some bread for my journey ahead. When I asked about the Great Candy House, they exchanged glances and seemed to rush me out of their home. I didn't mind it too much. I did have to make more progress on my travels after all.<br><br>The Darklands are really nice once you get past how dark and creepy it is, but it's too soon for me to speak on it since it's only been two days.<br><br>The signs nearby were of no help in guiding me. My map was only a little bit better. Before I knew it, I was lost again.<br><br>It was starting to get dark, and I realized I'd eaten the last of my bread. I was starting to feel dreary (and hungry) until I heard two voices in the distance. A voice mentioned something about idiotic adults... As they get closer, I could see the figures of two children, a boy and a girl. Desperate, I ran to them to ask for directions. At first they were wary, and even a bit surprised that I asked to see the Great Candy House, but they still pointed out where I should go and where on the map I was. When they heard my stomach grumbling, they even handed my a cookie and some foreign-looking candy. I didn't get to introduce myself or get their names, but they seemed to be in quite a hurry... and angry. <br><br>Well, I'll keep on going and see where I end up. Hopefully, I'll get there soon.
			<br><br>Regards!<br><br> K.
