			I'm close! I ran into an ogre today, by the name of Alistar, who was going down the path in a horse-drawn cart. He must've seen how tired I was and offered to give me a lift. The people of the Darklands are really quite nice!<br><br>There are no ogres where I'm from, so I couldn't help by stare. His piercings were really cool... maybe I should also get some.....<br><br>We stopped by an inn for the night. Apparently, the Great Candy House is only a few more miles away. I'm very excited! But also tired.
			<br><br>Until next time!<br><br> K.
