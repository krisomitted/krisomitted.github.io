			I reached the Great Candy House today, and boy, was I in for a shock...<br><br>Apparently, the Witch that owns it is a nudist! I'm cool with what people do as long as they're not hurting anyone, but isn't that a bit unsanitary? I wonder what the Darklands Food and Health Department think about this...<br><br> She was very nice and very helpful, but I just couldn't find it in me to buy any treats. I bought this nice little bookmark instead! Next on my to-see list is the Talking River. I'll stay in one of the inns nearby for tonight.
			<br><br>Regards!<br><br> K.
