			This inn is pretty nice. I was able to explore a lot of it today since the weather outside was so bad. I decided to stay another day because the proprieter of the inn, a spider-human, encouraged me to leave once the weather cleared up.<br><br>The people of the inn were very friendly during dinner time. A young girl, also on a journey I suppose, drew me a small map to use for the journey to the Talking River. I'm very excited.<br><br>Best!<br><br> K.
